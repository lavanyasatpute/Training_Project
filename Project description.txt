Certainly! Here's a detailed breakdown of the **Event Management Platform** features, along with a proposed **RASD map** (Requirements, Architecture, System Design) using the technologies you mentioned, and a step-by-step guide to implementing the platform:

---

### **Explanation of Features**
1. **Event Creation**: A system to create events with attributes such as title, description, schedule, location, and categories. You can also allow event organizers to edit and delete their events.
2. **Registration**: A module that enables users to register for events, view their registrations, and manage them (e.g., cancellation or changes).
3. **Ticketing**: Facilitates ticket sales by integrating payment systems, ticket inventory management, and issuing e-tickets to participants.
4. **Attendee Tracking**: Tracks check-ins and participation during the event using QR codes or unique IDs.
5. **Feedback and Surveys**: Post-event module to collect feedback, conduct surveys, and generate analytics for event improvement.

### **RASD (Requirements, Architecture, System Design) Map**

**1. Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - CRUD operations for events.
  - User registration and authentication.
  - Ticket sales and inventory management.
  - Attendance tracking and feedback collection.

- **Non-functional Requirements**:
  - Scalability to support high event participation.
  - Security for user data and payment information.
  - High performance for real-time updates.

**2. Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Angular (for UI/UX and event interactivity).
- **Backend**: Node.js (API development, business logic).
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS) for storing event details, user data, ticket inventory, etc.
- **ORM**: TypeORM (for database interaction).

**3. System Design**
- **Modules**:
  - Event Management: Create and list events.
  - User Module: Registration, login, and profile management.
  - Ticketing Module: Payment gateway integration.
  - Attendance Module: QR-code generation and scanning.
  - Feedback Module: Form creation and analytics.

- **APIs**:
  - `/events` (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE): Manage events.
  - `/register` (POST): Register for events.
  - `/tickets` (GET/POST): Ticket management.
  - `/feedback` (POST): Submit feedback.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**
#### **Frontend (Angular)**
1. **Set Up Angular Project**:
   - Create a new Angular project using `ng new`.
   - Install Angular Material or Bootstrap for UI components.

2. **Create Components**:
   - Event List, Event Details, Registration Form, User Profile, Feedback Form.

3. **Integrate REST APIs**:
   - Use Angular's `HttpClient` to call the backend APIs for event details, registrations, and ticketing.

4. **State Management**:
   - Implement state management using RxJS or a library like NgRx.

---

#### **Backend (Node.js with TypeORM)**
1. **Set Up Node.js Project**:
   - Initialize with `npm init` and install dependencies like `express`, `typeorm`, `mssql`.

2. **Database Connection**:
   - Configure TypeORM to connect to SSMS.
   - Define entities for `Event`, `User`, `Ticket`, `Feedback`.

3. **Build REST APIs**:
   - Use `express` to create endpoints for event management, user registration, ticketing, etc.

4. **Authentication**:
   - Integrate JWT for secure user authentication.

5. **Payment Integration**:
   - Use a payment gateway like Razorpay or Stripe for ticket purchases.

---

#### **Database (SSMS)**
1. **Design Database Schema**:
   - Tables: `Events`, `Users`, `Tickets`, `Feedback`.

2. **Set Relationships**:
   - Use TypeORM to define relationships like `One-to-Many` between `Event` and `Ticket`.

3. **Optimize Queries**:
   - Use indexes and stored procedures for performance optimization.

---

#### **Deployment**
1. **Frontend**: Host the Angular application on platforms like AWS S3 or Firebase.
2. **Backend**: Deploy the Node.js server using Docker or on cloud platforms like AWS EC2.
3. **Database**: Host Microsoft SQL Server on Azure SQL or other compatible cloud services.
